	abstract = {One of the most important challenges in {HumanRobot} Interaction ({HRI}) is the perception of the human state. When a robot physically engages with a human, such as during physical interaction and assistance, it is vital that the robot perceives as much information as possible about the human to properly guide its behavior. We examined the specific case of a robot handing a rigid object to a human and used only the robot’s force and motion sensors to determine when the human’s grasp was secure enough for the robot to safely release the object. From biomechanical reasoning, we assumed that safer grasps are stiffer grasps. We commanded our robot to impose small motions on the object being passed and measured the resulting force changes and used system identification techniques to measure and visualize changes in the human’s grasp stiffness. When subjects were instructed to grasp more tightly an object being passed, our robot could reliably detect increases in several measures of the multi-dimensional stiffness of the human’s grasp. Our technique also enabled us to measure the increases in damping with tighter grasps. This preliminary work demonstrates promising value for active haptic perception during physical {HRI}.},

	abstract = {We present the identification of the non-linear dynamics of a novel hovercraft design, employing end-to-end deep learning techniques. Our experimental setup consists of a hovercraft propelled by racing drone propellers mounted on a lightweight foam base, allowing it to float and be controlled freely on an air hockey table. We learn parametrized physics-inspired nonlinear models directly from data trajectories, leveraging gradient-based optimization techniques prevalent in machine learning research. The chosen model structure allows us to control the position of the hovercraft precisely on the air hockey table. We then analyze the prediction performance and demonstrate the closed-loop control performance on the real system.},
