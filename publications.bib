	abstract = {Mars Climate Orbiter (anciennement Mars Surveyor Orbiter) est une des deux sondes spatiales de l'agence spatiale américaine, la {NASA}, lancée en 1998 pour étudier la planète Mars. Cet orbiteur doit étudier la météorologie de la planète Mars, le cycle hydrologique et du dioxyde de carbone, dans le but de mieux modéliser le climat actuel de la planète mais également de reconstituer les changements climatiques passés.
Mars Climate Orbiter est un orbiteur de petite taille d'une masse au lancement de 629 kg dont 291 kg d'ergols utilisés essentiellement pour s'insérer en orbite. La sonde spatiale emporte deux instruments : une caméra permettant de prendre des images en lumière visible et dans l'infrarouge ainsi qu'un radiomètre collectant des données dans les mêmes longueurs d'onde.
Mars Climate Orbiter est lancée le 11 décembre 1998 par une fusée Delta {II} 7425. Après un transit de 7 mois entre la Terre et Mars, elle entame les manœuvres d'insertion sur une orbite martienne le 23 septembre 1999. À la suite d'une confusion d'unités, commise par les ingénieurs de la {NASA} et admise à demi-mot plus tard par Edward Weiler, le responsable des programmes de sciences spatiales de la {NASA}, la sonde se place sur une orbite trop basse et est détruite en traversant à grande vitesse la partie supérieure de l'atmosphère martienne. En effet, les valeurs communiquées pour les valeurs de poussée du moteur de freinage par la firme Lockheed étaient exprimées dans des unités anglo-saxonnes, or les ingénieurs de la {NASA} ont cru avoir des données exprimées dans le système international comme spécifié dans le contrat de sous-traitance. Les valeurs utilisées dans les logiciels de calcul étaient donc erronées. Cet échec qui est suivi quelques mois plus tard par celui de Mars Polar Lander secoue fortement l'agence spatiale américaine. Il sonne l'arrêt du programme Surveyor qui prévoyait le lancement de deux missions martiennes à bas coût tous les deux ans (à chaque ouverture d'une fenêtre de lancement vers Mars). Il ne remet cependant pas en cause la politique des missions à coût modéré qui se poursuivra par la suite avec de grands succès.},

In this paper, we present a system to automate this process by leveraging deep reinforcement learning techniques. Our system can learn quadruped locomotion from scratch using simple reward signals. In addition, users can provide an open loop reference to guide the learning process when more control over the learned gait is needed. The control policies are learned in a physics simulator and then deployed on real robots. In robotics, policies trained in simulation often do not transfer to the real world. We narrow this reality gap by improving the physics simulator and learning robust policies. We improve the simulation using system identification, developing an accurate actuator model and simulating latency. We learn robust controllers by randomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations and designing a compact observation space. We evaluate our system on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping. After learning in simulation, a quadruped robot can successfully perform both gaits in the real world.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of realizing the full spectrum of bipedal locomotion on a real robot with sim-to-real reinforcement learning ({RL}). A key challenge of learning legged locomotion is describing different gaits, via reward functions, in a way that is intuitive for the designer and speciﬁc enough to reliably learn the gait across different initial random seeds or hyperparameters. A common approach is to use reference motions (e.g. trajectories of joint positions) to guide learning. However, ﬁnding high-quality reference motions can be difﬁcult and the trajectories themselves narrowly constrain the space of learned motion. At the other extreme, reference-free reward functions are often underspeciﬁed (e.g. move forward) leading to massive variance in policy behavior, or are the product of signiﬁcant reward-shaping via trial-and-error, making them exclusive to speciﬁc gaits. In this work, we propose a rewardspeciﬁcation framework based on composing simple probabilistic periodic costs on basic forces and velocities. We instantiate this framework to deﬁne a parametric reward function with intuitive settings for all common bipedal gaits - standing, walking, hopping, running, and skipping. Using this function we demonstrate successful sim-to-real transfer of the learned gaits to the bipedal robot Cassie, as well as a generic policy that can transition between all of the two-beat gaits.},

It is proposed as an alternative to current regressive methods which require numerous repetitions to obtain average stiffness on a small segment of the hand trajectory. The method is based on the analysis of the reassigned spectrogram of the arm’s response to impulsive perturbations and can estimate arm stiffness on a trial-by-trial basis. Analytic and empirical methods are first derived and tested through modal analysis on synthetic data. The technique’s accuracy and robustness are assessed by modeling the estimation of stiffness time profiles changing at different rates and affected by different noise levels. Our method obtains results comparable with two well-known regressive techniques. We also test how the technique can identify the viscoelastic component of nonlinear and higher than second order systems with a non-parametrical approach. The technique proposed here is very impervious to noise and can be used easily for both postural and movement tasks. Estimations of stiffness profiles are possible with only one perturbation, making our method a useful tool for estimating limb stiffness during motor learning and adaptation tasks, and for understanding the modulation of stiffness in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases.},

All touch gestures were performed in three variants: gentle, normal and rough on a pressure sensor grid wrapped around a mannequin arm. Recognition of these 14 gesture classes using various classiﬁers yielded accuracies up to 60 \%; moreover, gentle gestures proved to be harder to classify than normal and rough gestures. We further investigated how different classiﬁers, interpersonal differences, gesture confusions and gesture variants affected the recognition accuracy. Finally, we present directions for further research to ensure proper transfer of the touch modality from interpersonal interaction to areas such as human–robot interaction ({HRI}).},

Interpreting human touch gestures is a nuanced, challenging task with extreme gaps between human and robot capability. Among prior works that demonstrate human touch recognition capability, differences in sensors, gesture classes, feature sets, and classiﬁcation algorithms yield a conglomerate of non-transferable results and a glaring lack of a standard. To address this gap, this work presents 1) four proposed touch gesture classes that cover the majority of the gesture characteristics identiﬁed in the literature, 2) the collection of an extensive force dataset on a common {pHRI} robotic arm with only its internal wrist force-torque sensor, and 3) an exhaustive performance comparison of combinations of feature sets and classiﬁcation algorithms on this dataset. We demonstrate high classiﬁcation accuracies among our proposed gesture deﬁnitions on a test set, emphasizing that neural network classiﬁers on the raw data outperform other combinations of feature sets and algorithms.},

The classifier uses the giver’s kinematic behaviors (e.g. joint angles, distances of joints from each other and with respect to the receiver) to determine a giver’s intent to hand over an object. We used a bagged random forest to determine how informative features were in predicting the occurrence of handovers, and to assist in selecting a core set of features to be used by the classifier. Altogether, 22 kinematic features were chosen for developing handover detection models and later testing of generalization performance. Test results indicated an overall maximum accuracy of 97.5\% by the {SVM} in its capacity to distinguish between handover and nonhandover motions. The classification ability of the {SVM} was found to be unaffected across four kernel functions (linear, quadratic, cubic and radial basis). These results demonstrate considerable potential for detection of handovers and other gestures for human–robot interaction using kinematic features.},

The basic hypothesis is that in human handshaking force control there is a balance between an intrinsic (open-loop) and extrinsic (closed-loop) contributions. We use an underactuated anthropomorphic robotic hand, the Pisa/{IIT} hand, instrumented with a set of pressure sensors estimating the grip force applied by humans. In a ﬁrst set of experiments, we ask subjects to mimic a given force proﬁle applied by the robot hand, to understand how human perceive and are able to reproduce a handshaking force. Using the obtained results, we implement three different handshaking controllers, in which we varied the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions and in a second set of experiments, we ask participants to evaluate them in a user study. We show that a sensorimotor delay mimicking the reaction time of the central nervous system is beneﬁcial for making interactions more human-like. Moreover, we demonstrate that humans exploit closed-loop control for handshaking. By varying the controller we show that we can change the perceived handshake quality and also inﬂuence personality traits attributed to the robot.},

In this paper, we explore learning a robust model that maps tactile sensor signals to force. We speciﬁcally explore learning a mapping for the {SynTouch} {BioTac} sensor via neural networks. We propose a voxelized input feature layer for spatial signals and leverage information about the sensor surface to regularize the loss function. To learn a robust tactile force model that transfers across tasks, we generate ground truth data from three different sources: (1) the {BioTac} rigidly mounted to a force torque ({FT}) sensor, (2) a robot interacting with a ball rigidly attached to the same {FT} sensor, and (3) through force inference on a planar pushing task by formalizing the mechanics as a system of particles and optimizing over the object motion. A total of 140k samples were collected from the three sources. We achieve a median angular accuracy of 3.5 degrees in predicting force direction (66\% improvement over the current state of the art) and a median magnitude accuracy of 0.06 N (93\% improvement) on a test dataset. Additionally, we evaluate the learned force model in a force feedback grasp controller performing object lifting and gentle placement.

We choose to focus on the classiﬁcation problem deﬁned to enable the robot to ﬁnd the ﬁnger opening movement. The main challenge is that the classiﬁcation should be run online, at a comparable rate to the controller. To achieve a computationally efﬁcient classiﬁer, the Wavelet Packet Transformation is used for feature extraction, and then we used the Fisher criterion to reduce the dimension of features. A Relevance Vector Machine is used for the continuous classiﬁcation procedure mainly for its sparsity. Some recorded data and the results from dimension reduction are shown, then we discuss the accuracy and sparsity of the classiﬁcation by Relevance Vector Machine in this application. The software of continuous classiﬁcation on forces is then tested on the robot for interactive object exchange between human and robot, which gives promising results.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in cooperative {HumanRobot} Interaction is object handover. Existing works in this area assume the human can reliably grasp the object from the robot hand. However, in some situations the human can produce perturbing forces in the object that are not meant to end in a handover. These perturbations can result in the object being dropped or the robot hand being damaged. This paper addresses this problem and presents a mechanism for reliable robot to human object handover implemented in a Shadow Robot hand endowed with tactile sensing. Given a stable grasping conﬁguration, using {BioTAC} sensors we are able to estimate the contact forces applied to the object, and provide a feedback signal to a joint effort controller to maintain grasp forces despite perturbations. Our system is able to identify between object pulling forces which should result in an object handover, and other disturbances. Experimental results show that the hand releases the object only when the object is pulled, validating the proposed algorithm.},

The challenge for a robot-human handover is to both equip the robot with the appropriate sensors as well as devise handover controllers that effectively use them to prevent failures. In this paper we use object acceleration as an indicator of an impending handover failure and propose a handover controller that has re-grasping mechanism to prevent falling of the object in case of an imperfect handover. The work is motivated by our observation that humans primarily rely on vision to prevent handover failure. We also propose a novel acceleration sensing setup that can be integrated into a robot gripper. The handover controller is implemented on Baxter Research robot equipped with the proposed sensor and is shown to be effective in preventing object fall.},

	shorttitle = {Object Handovers},
	abstract = {This article surveys the literature on human-robot object handovers. A handover is a collaborative joint action where an agent, the giver, gives an object to another agent, the receiver. The physical exchange starts when the receiver ﬁrst contacts the object held by the giver and ends when the giver fully releases the object to the receiver. However, important cognitive and physical processes begin before the physical exchange, including initiating implicit agreement with respect to the location and timing of the exchange. From this perspective, we structure our review into the two main phases delimited by the aforementioned events: 1) a pre-handover phase, and 2) the physical exchange. We focus our analysis on the two actors (giver and receiver) and report the state of the art of robotic givers (robot-to-human handovers) and the robotic receivers (humanto-robot handovers). We report a comprehensive list of qualitative and quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the interaction. While focusing our review on the cognitive level (e.g., prediction, perception, motion planning, learning) and the physical level (e.g., motion, grasping, grip release) of the handover, we brieﬂy discuss also the concepts of safety, social context, and ergonomics. We compare the behaviours displayed during human-to-human handovers to the state of the art of robotic assistants, and identify the major areas of improvement for robotic assistants to reach performance comparable to human interactions. Finally, we propose a minimal set of metrics that should be used in order to enable a fair comparison among the approaches.},

This research focuses on the design and development of an appropriate set of behaviour control strategies for robot-tohuman object handover by first understanding how an equivalent human-human object handover can be used to establish a framework for a robotic behaviour-based approach. To achieve this goal, a real-world human-to-human object transferring task has been carried out in order to understand the dynamic and kinematic behavioural characteristics of the haptic interaction between two human participants. The profiles of interactive forces between the giver and receiver were measured as a function of time, and how they are modulated while performing the cooperative tasks, was evaluated. Based on key features as proposed, these can be subsequently used to design and develop the conceptual guideline for a human-like behaviour-based service robot. Position-based force control using proportional plus integral ({PI}) and fuzzy logic control ({FLC}) algorithms were adopted to control the robot end effector position and interactive force in real-time. The results allowed a comparison of the {PI} and {FLC} control strategies. It can be concluded that the quantitative measurement of the controlled robot performance is close to that of the human and can be considered acceptable for human-robot interaction. The effective object transferring tasks provide robot to be able to successfully pass the object to the human in a safe, reliable and timely manner. However, after careful analysis with regard the test results, the control based {FLC} scheme was shown to be slightly superior to {PI} control by actively compensating for the dynamics in the non-linear system and demonstrated better overall performance and stability.},

By interactively, we mean that the robot should be able to adapt both the target grasp and the approach movement of its arm. If the human decides to change the way he/she presents the object, the robot should possibly choose a grasp different from the one that was previously selected and use a different motion to reach the object. Such reactive capacities could be of great interest in the ﬁeld of assistive robotics and, more generally, human-robot interaction. The paper focused on some points: Grasp planning to reactively select how to grasp the object from the human hand, trajectory planning to compute a comfortable approach motion and interpretation of the interaction forces during the object exchange. For the latter point, a smart device was specially conceived and realized to measure the interaction forces.},

It is a common practice among researchers to simplify dynamic of system by assumpssions such as permanent contact or incipient slip condition between object and gripper. Although such assumptions might be good in general grasping problem, where applying large contact forces is permissible, they are not valid in the case of safe grasping in which the contact forces should be minimal. This paper presents a new controller inspired by human method of grasping. The proposed controller, which only needs measurement of the contact forces, is then employed in conjunction with jacobian transpose method for grasping by multi-link fingers. Versatility of proposed algorithm is shown by means of several numerical examples as well as analytical developments.},

In addition, an implicit social contract appears to exist in which the giver is responsible for ensuring object safety in the handover and the receiver is responsible for maintaining the efficiency of the handover. Compared with prior studies, our analysis of experimental data show that there are important differences between the strategies used by humans for both picking up/placing objects on table and that used for handing over objects, indicating the need for specific robot handover strategies as well.

In this paper, we are focused on robot-to-human object handover. The main challenge in this case is how to reduce the failure rate, i.e., to ensure that the object does not fall (object safety), while at the same time allowing the human to easily acquire the object (smoothness). To endow the robot with a failure recovery mechanism, we investigated how humans detect failure during the transfer phase of the handover. We conducted a human study that showed that a human giver primarily relies on vision rather than haptic sensing to detect the fall of the object. Motivated by this study, a robotic handover system is proposed that consists of a motion sensor attached to the robot’s gripper, a force sensor at the base of the gripper, and a controller that is capable of regrasping the object if it starts falling. The proposed system is implemented on a Baxter robot and is shown to achieve a smooth and safe handover.},

	abstract = {The way an object is released by the passer to a partner is fundamental for the success of the handover and for the experienced fluency and quality of the interaction. Nonetheless, although its apparent simplicity, object handover involves a complex combination of predictive and reactive control mechanisms that were not fully investigated so far. Here, we show that passers use visual-feedback based anticipatory control to trigger the beginning of the release, to launch the appropriate motor program, and adapt such predictions to different speeds of the receiver’s reaching out movements. In particular, the passer starts releasing the object in synchrony with the collision with the receiver, regardless of the receiver’s speed, but the passer’s speed of grip force release is correlated with receiver speed. When visual feedback is removed, the beginning of the passer’s release is delayed proportionally with the receiver’s reaching out speed; however, the correlation between the passer’s peak rate of change of grip force is maintained. In a second study with 11 participants receiving an object from a robotic hand programmed to release following stereotypical biomimetic profiles, we found that handovers are experienced as more fluent when they exhibit more reactive release behaviours, shorter release durations, and shorter handover durations. The outcomes from the two studies contribute understanding of the roles of sensory input in the strategy that empower humans to perform smooth and safe handovers, and they suggest methods for programming controllers that would enable artificial hands to hand over objects with humans in an easy, natural and efficient way.},

The present study examined haptic contributions in object handover. On each trial one participant held an object and passed it to the other participant at self-selected, fixed or randomly varied positions. In some trials, the receiver wore a glove to attenuate tactile information. The results showed that the passer’s time of grip release rel- ative to contact was later when the transfer location randomly varied or when the receiver wore the glove. On the other hand, forces at contact dropped across trials with negligible effects of glove or transfer location. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the dyad reduced redundant forces at contact by forming a stereotypical handover movement in a feedforward manner, while the sensory feedback modulates timing of object handover to avoid premature re- lease of grip by the passer.},

	abstract = {The goal of the present study was to investigate how grip forces are applied when transferring stable control of an object from one person to another. We asked how grip forces would be modiﬁed by the passer to (1) control for inertial forces as the object was transported toward the receiver and (2) control for the impending perturbation when the receiver made contact with the object. Twelve volunteers worked in pairs during this experiment. One partner, playing the role of passer, transported an object with embedded load cells forward or held the object at an interception location. The second partner, playing the role of receiver, waited at an interception location or reached toward the passed object. Kinematic results indicated that while passers performed a stereotypical movement, receivers were sensitive to the motion of the object as they reached to make contact. Grip force results indicated that passers’ grip forces and grip/load force ratios were variable on a trial-to-trial basis, suggesting that a reﬁned internal model of the passing task was not achieved within the timeframe of the experiment. Furthermore, a decoupling of the temporal and magnitude characteristics of the grip and inertial forces was noted in conditions where passers transported the object toward the receiver. During object transfer, it was noted that passers used visual feedback-based anticipatory control to precisely time initial grip force release, while somatosensory control was used by both the passer and receiver to precisely coordinate transfer rate.},

In particular, it examines how changes in a robot behaviour inﬂuence human participation and the overall interaction. With a 2x2x2 experimental design, we vary three basic factors and observe both the interaction position and forces. We ﬁnd the robot’s initial pose can inform the giver about the upcoming handover geometry and impact ﬂuency and efﬁciency. Also we ﬁnd variations in grasp method and retraction speed induce signiﬁcantly different interaction forces. This effect may occur by changing the giver’s perception of object safety and hence their release timing. Alternatively, it may stem from unnatural or mismatched robot movements. We determine that making the robot predictable is important: we observe a learning effect with forces declining over repeated trials. Simultaneously, the participants’ self-reported discomfort with the robot decreases and perception of emotional warmth increases. Thus, we posit users are learning to predict the robot, becoming more familiar with its behaviours, and perhaps becoming more trusting of the robot’s ability to safely receive the object. We ﬁnd these results exciting as we believe a robot can become a trusted partner in collaborative tasks.},

This paper presents a method for the estimation of the interaction forces between a human and a robot using a gripper with proprioceptive sensing. Speciﬁcally, we measure forces exerted by a human limb grabbed by an underactuated gripper in a frontal plane using only the gripper’s own sensors. This is achieved via a regression method, trained with experimental data from the values of the phalanx angles and actuator signals. The proposed method is intended for adaptive shared control in limb manipulation. Although adding force sensors provides better performance, the results obtained are accurate enough for this application. This approach requires no additional hardware: it relies uniquely on the gripper motor feedback—current, position and torque—and joint angles. Also, it is computationally cheap, so processing times are low enough to allow continuous human-adapted {pHRI} for shared control.},

	abstract = {Background: The human motor system is highly redundant, having more kinematic degrees of freedom than necessary to complete a given task. Understanding how kinematic redundancies are utilized in different tasks remains a fundamental question in motor control. One possibility is that they can be used to tune the mechanical properties of a limb to the specific requirements of a task. For example, many tasks such as tool usage compromise arm stability along specific directions. These tasks only can be completed if the nervous system adapts the mechanical properties of the arm such that the arm, coupled to the tool, remains stable. The purpose of this study was to determine if posture selection is a critical component of endpoint stiffness regulation during unconstrained tasks.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Three-dimensional (3D) estimates of endpoint stiffness were used to quantify limb mechanics. Most previous studies examining endpoint stiffness adaptation were completed in 2D using constrained postures to maintain a non-redundant mapping between joint angles and hand location. Our hypothesis was that during unconstrained conditions, subjects would select arm postures that matched endpoint stiffness to the functional requirements of the task. The hypothesis was tested during endpoint tracking tasks in which subjects interacted with unstable haptic environments, simulated using a 3D robotic manipulator. We found that arm posture had a significant effect on endpoint tracking accuracy and that subjects selected postures that improved tracking performance. For environments in which arm posture had a large effect on tracking accuracy, the self-selected postures oriented the direction of maximal endpoint stiffness towards the direction of the unstable haptic environment.
Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate how changes in arm posture can have a dramatic effect on task performance and suggest that postural selection is a fundamental mechanism by which kinematic redundancies can be exploited to regulate arm stiffness in unconstrained tasks.},

	abstract = {Although many daily tasks tend to destabilize arm posture, it is still possible to have stable interactions with the environment by regulating the multijoint mechanics of the arm in a task-appropriate manner. For postural tasks, this regulation involves the appropriate control of endpoint stiffness, which represents the stiffness of the arm at the hand. Although experimental studies have been used to evaluate endpoint stiffness control, including the orientation of maximal stiffness, the underlying neural strategies remain unknown. Specifically, the relative importance of feedforward and feedback mechanisms has yet to be determined due to the difficulty separately identifying the contributions of these mechanisms in human experiments. This study used a previously validated three-dimensional musculoskeletal model of the arm to quantify the degree to which the orientation of maximal endpoint stiffness could be changed using only steady-state muscle activations, used to represent feedforward motor commands. Our hypothesis was that the feedforward control of endpoint stiffness orientation would be significantly constrained by the biomechanical properties of the musculoskeletal system. Our results supported this hypothesis, demonstrating substantial biomechanical constraints on the ability to regulate endpoint stiffness throughout the workspace. The ability to regulate stiffness orientation was further constrained by additional task requirements, such as the need to support the arm against gravity or exert forces on the environment. Together, these results bound the degree to which slowly varying feedforward motor commands can be used to regulate the orientation of maximum arm stiffness and provide a context for better understanding conditions in which feedback control may be needed.},

	abstract = {The present paper examines human hand impedance characteristics, including inertia and viscosity as well as stiffness, in multi-joint arm movements. While a subject maintains a given hand location, small external disturbances are applied to his hand by a manipulandum. The corresponding force-displacement vectors are measured and sampled over time in order to estimate the hand impedance by means of a second-order linear model. The experimental results in different subjects and hand locations are summarized as follows: (1) the estimated inertia matrices of the human hand well agrees with computed values using a twojoint arm model, (2) spatial variations of the stiffness ellipses are consistent with the experimental results of Mussa-Ivaldi et al. (1985), (3) hand stiffness and viscosity increase with the grip force of the subject, and (4) viscosity and stiffness ellipses tend to have similar orientation. The accuracy of the impedance estimation method is validated with a mechanical spring-mass system with known parameters.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose an intuitive and real-time model of the human arm active endpoint stiffness. In our model, the symmetric and positive-deﬁnite stiffness matrix is constructed through the eigendecomposition Kc = V {DV} T, where V is an orthonormal matrix whose columns are the normalized eigenvectors of Kc, and D is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of Kc. In this formulation, we propose to construct V and D directly by exploiting the geometric information from a reduced human arm skeleton structure in 3D and from the assumption that human arm muscles work synergistically when co-contracted. Through the perturbation experiments across multiple subjects under different arm conﬁgurations and muscle activation states, we identiﬁed the model parameters and examined the modeling accuracy. In comparison to our previous models for predicting human active arm endpoint stiffness, the new model offers signiﬁcant advantages such as fast identiﬁcation and personalization due to its principled simplicity. The proposed model is suitable for applications such as teleoperation, human–robot interaction and collaboration, and human ergonomic assessments, where a personalizable and real-time human kinodynamic model is a crucial requirement.},

            {ExxonMobil}’s own climate models showed that fossil fuel use would cause climate warming.
          , 
            
              {BACKGROUND}
              In 2015, investigative journalists discovered internal company memos indicating that Exxon oil company has known since the late 1970s that its fossil fuel products could lead to global warming with “dramatic environmental effects before the year 2050.” Additional documents then emerged showing that the {US} oil and gas industry’s largest trade association had likewise known since at least the 1950s, as had the coal industry since at least the 1960s, and electric utilities, Total oil company, and {GM} and Ford motor companies since at least the 1970s. Scholars and journalists have analyzed the texts contained in these documents, providing qualitative accounts of fossil fuel interests’ knowledge of climate science and its implications. In 2017, for instance, we demonstrated that Exxon’s internal documents, as well as peer-reviewed studies published by Exxon and {ExxonMobil} Corp scientists, overwhelmingly acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused. By contrast, the majority of Mobil and {ExxonMobil} Corp’s public communications promoted doubt on the matter.
            
            
              {ADVANCES}
              Many of the uncovered fossil fuel industry documents include explicit projections of the amount of warming expected to occur over time in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Yet, these numerical and graphical data have received little attention. Indeed, no one has systematically reviewed climate modeling projections by any fossil fuel interest. What exactly did oil and gas companies know, and how accurate did their knowledge prove to be? Here, we address these questions by reporting and analyzing all known global warming projections documented by—and in many cases modeled by—Exxon and {ExxonMobil} Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003.
              Our results show that in private and academic circles since the late 1970s and early 1980s, {ExxonMobil} predicted global warming correctly and skillfully. Using established statistical techniques, we find that 63 to 83\% of the climate projections reported by {ExxonMobil} scientists were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming. {ExxonMobil}’s average projected warming was 0.20° ± 0.04°C per decade, which is, within uncertainty, the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007. The average “skill score” and level of uncertainty of {ExxonMobil}’s climate models (67 to 75\% and ±21\%, respectively) were also similar to those of the independent models.
              
                Moreover, we show that {ExxonMobil} scientists correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age in favor of a “carbon dioxide induced ‘super-interglacial’”; accurately predicted that human-caused global warming would first be detectable in the year 2000 ± 5; and reasonably estimated how much {CO}
                2
                would lead to dangerous warming.
              
            
            
              {OUTLOOK}
              Today, dozens of cities, counties, and states are suing oil and gas companies for their “longstanding internal scientific knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change and public deception campaigns.” The European Parliament and the {US} Congress have held hearings, {US} President Joe Biden has committed to holding fossil fuel companies accountable, and a grassroots social movement has arisen under the moniker \#{ExxonKnew}. Our findings demonstrate that {ExxonMobil} didn’t just know “something” about global warming decades ago—they knew as much as academic and government scientists knew. But whereas those scientists worked to communicate what they knew, {ExxonMobil} worked to deny it—including overemphasizing uncertainties, denigrating climate models, mythologizing global cooling, feigning ignorance about the discernibility of human-caused warming, and staying silent about the possibility of stranded fossil fuel assets in a carbon-constrained world.

Existing methods are either domain-specific or require strong assumptions that cannot be met in realistic datasets. Reinforcement learning ({RL}), as an incremental self-learning approach, could avoid the two issues well. However, the current investigation is far from comprehensive. In this paper, we propose a generic policy-based {RL} framework to address the time series anomaly detection problem. The policy-based time series anomaly detector ({PTAD}) is progressively learned from the interactions with time-series data in the absence of constraints. Experimental results show that it outperforms the value-based temporal anomaly detector and other state-of-the-art detection methods whether training and test datasets come from the same source or not. Furthermore, the tradeoff between precision and recall is well respected by the {PTAD}, which is beneficial to fulfill various industrial requirements.},

	abstract = {Model predictive control ({MPC}) is an advanced method of process control that is used to control a process while satisfying a set of constraints. It has been in use in the process industries in chemical plants and oil refineries since the 1980s. In recent years it has also been used in power system balancing models and in power electronics. Model predictive controllers rely on dynamic models of the process, most often linear empirical models obtained by system identification. The main advantage of {MPC} is the fact that it allows the current timeslot to be optimized, while keeping future timeslots in account. This is achieved by optimizing a finite time-horizon, but only implementing the current timeslot and then optimizing again, repeatedly, thus differing from a linear–quadratic regulator ({LQR}). Also {MPC} has the ability to anticipate future events and can take control actions accordingly. {PID} controllers do not have this predictive ability. {MPC} is nearly universally implemented as a digital control, although there is research into achieving faster response times with specially designed analog circuitry.Generalized predictive control ({GPC}) and dynamic matrix control ({DMC}) are classical examples of {MPC}.},

L'équilibre de Nash est donc tel qu'aucun joueur ne regrette son choix (il n'aurait pas pu faire mieux) au vu du choix des autres, les choix étant, comme toujours en théorie des jeux, simultanés.
Souvent l'équilibre de Nash est présenté comme une situation où chacun adopte la meilleure réponse « compte tenu » du choix des autres, ce qui peut laisser croire que ce choix est connu — alors qu'il n'en est rien, pour des raisons évidentes (A déciderait en « voyant » le choix de B qui lui-même déciderait « en voyant » le choix de A).
Les prévisions des joueurs sur ce que vont faire les autres sont donc un élément essentiel de l'équilibre de Nash. Elles en sont aussi le principal point faible, ces prévisions — élément essentiellement subjectif — n'ayant généralement pas de raison d'être correctes, comme c'est le cas dans les modèles du duopole de Cournot et de Bertrand. 
L'équilibre de Nash peut donc être considéré comme une « solution » d'un jeu, au sens mathématique (résolution d'un système d'équations), mais pas forcément si on entend par « solution » une prédiction de ce que feront effectivement les joueurs placés dans la situation décrite par le jeu — même en supposant qu'ils sont rationnels.
L'équilibre de Nash a été nommé d'après le mathématicien John Forbes Nash. Il lui a valu le « Prix Nobel » d'économie en 1994. Cette contribution a été célébrée dans le monde de l'économie comme « l'une des avancées intellectuelles extraordinaires du {XXe} siècle ».},

	abstract = {La théorie des jeux est un domaine des mathématiques qui propose une description formelle d'interactions stratégiques entre agents (appelés « joueurs »). Les fondements mathématiques de la théorie moderne des jeux sont décrits autour des années 1920 par Ernst Zermelo dans l'article Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels, et par Émile Borel dans l'article « La théorie du jeu et les équations intégrales à noyau symétrique ». Ces idées sont ensuite développées par Oskar Morgenstern et John von Neumann en 1944 dans leur ouvrage Theory of Games and Economic Behavior qui est considéré comme le fondement de la théorie des jeux moderne. Il s'agissait de modéliser les jeux à somme nulle où la somme des gains entre les joueurs est toujours égale à zéro. La théorie des jeux devient dès ce moment un outil théorique important de la microéconomie.
Depuis 1944, 11 « prix Nobel d'économie » ont été décernés à des économistes pour leurs recherches sur la théorie des jeux. Outre le champ de l'économie, la théorie des jeux trouve des applications dans les sciences sociales, les sciences politiques, dans l'analyse stratégique comme en relations internationales ou en théorie des organisations et en biologie évolutionniste.},

   Estimation of the parameters in an {HMM} can be performed using maximum likelihood. For linear chain {HMMs}, the Baum–Welch algorithm can be used to estimate the parameters.

Informally, this may be thought of as, "What happens next depends only on the state of affairs now." A countably infinite sequence, in which the chain moves state at discrete time steps, gives a discrete-time Markov chain ({DTMC}). A continuous-time process is called a continuous-time Markov chain ({CTMC}). It is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.
Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world processes, such as studying cruise control systems in motor vehicles, queues or lines of customers arriving at an airport, currency exchange rates and animal population dynamics.Markov processes are the basis for general stochastic simulation methods known as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which are used for simulating sampling from complex probability distributions, and have found application in Bayesian statistics, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, physics, chemistry, economics, finance, signal processing, information theory and speech processing.The adjectives Markovian and Markov are used to describe something that is related to a Markov process.},

This is different from and more difficult than the traditional classification problem, which tries to distinguish between two or more classes with the training set containing objects from all the classes. Examples include the monitoring of helicopter gearboxes, motor failure prediction, or the operational status of a nuclear plant as 'normal': In this scenario, there are few, if any, examples of catastrophic system states; only the statistics of normal operation are known.
While many of the above approaches focus on the case of removing a small number of outliers or anomalies, one can also learn the other extreme, where the single class covers a small coherent subset of the data, using an information bottleneck approach.},

For realizing {UAV}-assisted aerial surveillance or ﬂexible mobile cellular services, robust wireless charging mechanisms are essential for delivering energy sources from charging towers (i.e., charging infrastructure) to their associated {UAVs} for seamless operations of autonomous {UAVs} in the sky. In order to actively and intelligently manage the energy resources in charging towers, a {MADRL}-based coordinated energy management system is desired and proposed for energy resource sharing among charging towers. When the required energy for charging {UAVs} is not enough in charging towers, the energy purchase from utility company (i.e., energy source provider in local energy market) is desired, which takes high costs. Therefore, the main objective of our proposed coordinated {MADRL}-based energy sharing learning algorithm is minimizing energy purchase from external utility companies to minimize system-operational costs. Finally, our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed coordinated {MADRL}-based algorithm achieves desired performance improvements.},

However, recalculation of the optimal results is too slow for real-time operations in dynamic environments because of the large number of calculations required. In this paper, we propose an artiﬁcial intelligence method named simultaneous target assignment and path planning ({STAPP}) based on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient ({MADDPG}) algorithm, which is a type of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. In {STAPP}, the {MUTAPP} problem is ﬁrst constructed as a multi-agent system. Then, the {MADDPG} framework is used to train the system to solve target assignment and path planning simultaneously according to a corresponding reward structure. The proposed system can deal with dynamic environments effectively as its execution only requires the locations of the {UAVs}, targets, and threat areas. Real-time performance can be guaranteed as the neural network used in the system is simple. In addition, we develop a technique to improve the training effect and use experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in deep reinforcement learning are concerned with creating decision-making agents which can perform well in various complex domains. A particular approach which has received increasing attention is multi-agent reinforcement learning, in which multiple agents learn concurrently to coordinate their actions. In such multi-agent environments, additional learning problems arise due to the continually changing decision-making policies of agents. This paper surveys recent works that address the non-stationarity problem in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The surveyed methods range from modiﬁcations in the training procedure, such as centralized training, to learning representations of the opponent’s policy, meta-learning, communication, and decentralized learning. The survey concludes with a list of open problems and possible lines of future research.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning ({RL}) has achieved several high proﬁle successes in difﬁcult decision-making problems. However, these algorithms typically require a huge amount of data before they reach reasonable performance. In fact, their performance during learning can be extremely poor. This may be acceptable for a simulator, but it severely limits the applicability of deep {RL} to many real-world tasks, where the agent must learn in the real environment. In this paper we study a setting where the agent may access data from previous control of the system. We present an algorithm, Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations ({DQfD}), that leverages small sets of demonstration data to massively accelerate the learning process even from relatively small amounts of demonstration data and is able to automatically assess the necessary ratio of demonstration data while learning thanks to a prioritized replay mechanism. {DQfD} works by combining temporal difference updates with supervised classiﬁcation of the demonstrator’s actions. We show that {DQfD} has better initial performance than Prioritized Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks ({PDD} {DQN}) as it starts with better scores on the ﬁrst million steps on 41 of 42 games and on average it takes {PDD} {DQN} 83 million steps to catch up to {DQfD}’s performance. {DQfD} learns to out-perform the best demonstration given in 14 of 42 games. In addition, {DQfD} leverages human demonstrations to achieve state-of-the-art results for 11 games. Finally, we show that {DQfD} performs better than three related algorithms for incorporating demonstration data into {DQN}.},

This paper proposes a two-phase framework for detecting indoor human trajectory anomalies based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise ({DBSCAN}). The ﬁrst phase of the framework groups datasets into clusters. In the second phase, the abnormality of a new trajectory is checked. A new metric called the longest common sub-sequence using indoor walking distance and semantic label ({LCSS}\_IS) is proposed to calculate the similarity between trajectories, extending from the longest common sub-sequence ({LCSS}). Moreover, a {DBSCAN} cluster validity index ({DCVI}) is proposed to improve the trajectory clustering performance. The {DCVI} is used to choose the epsilon parameter for {DBSCAN}. The proposed method is evaluated using two real trajectory datasets: {MIT} Badge and {sCREEN}. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively detects human trajectory anomalies in indoor spaces. With the {MIT} Badge dataset, the proposed method achieves 89.03\% in terms of F1-score for hypothesized anomalies and above 93\% for all synthesized anomalies. In the {sCREEN} dataset, the proposed method also achieves impressive results in F1-score on synthesized anomalies: 89.92\% for rare location visit anomalies (τ = 0.5) and 93.63\% for other anomalies.},

Various algorithms based on learning of normal trajectory patterns have been proposed for this problem. Yet, these algorithms typically suffer from one or more limitations: They are not designed for sequential analysis of incomplete trajectories or online learning based on an incrementally updated training set. Moreover, they typically involve tuning of many parameters, including ad-hoc anomaly thresholds, and may therefore suffer from overﬁtting and poorly-calibrated alarm rates. In this article, we propose and investigate the Sequential Hausdorff Nearest-Neighbor Conformal Anomaly Detector ({SHNN}-{CAD}) for online learning and sequential anomaly detection in trajectories. This is a parameter-light algorithm that offers a well-founded approach to the calibration of the anomaly threshold. The discords algorithm, originally proposed by Keogh et al., is another parameter-light anomaly detection algorithm that has previously been shown to have good classiﬁcation performance on a wide range of time-series datasets, including trajectory data. We implement and investigate the performance of {SHNN}-{CAD} and the discords algorithm on four different labeled trajectory datasets. The results show that {SHNN}-{CAD} achieves competitive classiﬁcation performance with minimum parameter tuning during unsupervised online learning and sequential anomaly detection in trajectories.},

A common state-of-the-art solution to this problem relies on a Hidden Markov Model ({HMM}) to identify the most plausible road sequence for a given trajectory. While this approach has been shown to work well on sparse and noisy data, the algorithm has a high computational complexity and becomes slow when working with large trajectories and extended search radii. We propose an optimization to the original approach which signiﬁcantly reduces the number of state transitions that need to be evaluated in order to identify the correct solution. In experiments with publicly available benchmark data, the proposed optimization yields nearly identical map-matching results as the original algorithm, but reduces the algorithm runtime by up to 45\%. We demonstrate that the effects of our optimization become more pronounced when dealing with larger problem spaces and indicate how our approach can be combined with other recent optimizations to further reduce the overall algorithm runtime.},

In this paper, we propose trajectory distance metrics based on a recurrent neural network to measure similarities and detect anomalies from trajectory data. First, we use an autoencoder to capture the dynamic features of a trajectory. The distance between two trajectories is deﬁned by the reconstruction errors based on the learned models. We then detect anomalies based on the nearest neighbors using the proposed metric. As such, we can deal with various kinds of anomalies in diﬀerent scenes and detect anomalous trajectories in either a supervised or unsupervised manner. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art anomaly detections on the benchmark datasets.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis ({PCA}) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique with applications in data analysis, visualization and data preprocessing. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data onto a new coordinate system (principal components) such that the directions capturing the largest variation in the data can be easily identified. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science.The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\}
   unit vectors, where the 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle i\}
  -th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first 
  
    
      
        i
        −
        1
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle i-1\}
   vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.
In data analysis, the first principal component of a set of  
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\}
   variables, presumed to be jointly normally distributed, is the derived variable formed as a linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance. The second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed, and we may proceed through  
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\}
   iterations until all the variance is explained. {PCA} is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.
{PCA} is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle i\}
  -th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first 
  
    
      
        i
        −
        1
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle i-1\}
   principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.
For either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. {PCA} is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain-specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. {PCA} is also related to canonical correlation analysis ({CCA}). {CCA} defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while {PCA} defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset. Robust and L1-norm-based variants of standard {PCA} have also been proposed.},

	abstract = {Time series outlier detection has been extensively studied with many advanced algorithms proposed in the past decade. Despite these efforts, very few studies have investigated how we should benchmark the existing algorithms. In particular, using synthetic datasets for evaluation has become a common practice in the literature, and thus it is crucial to have a general synthetic criterion to benchmark algorithms. This is a non-trivial task because the existing synthetic methods are very different in different applications and the outlier deﬁnitions are often ambiguous. To bridge this gap, we propose a behavior-driven taxonomy for time series outliers and categorize outliers into point- and pattern-wise outliers with clear context deﬁnitions. Following the new taxonomy, we then present a general synthetic criterion and generate 35 synthetic datasets accordingly. We further identify 4 multivariate realworld datasets from different domains and benchmark 9 algorithms on the synthetic and the real-world datasets. Surprisingly, we observe that some classical algorithms could outperform many recent deep learning approaches. The datasets, preprocessing and synthetic scripts, and the algorithm implementations are made publicly available at https://github.com/datamllab/tods/tree/benchmark.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a signiﬁcant margin. Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on {ImageNet} classiﬁcation: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

	abstract = {The learning of domain-invariant representations in the context of domain adaptation with neural networks is considered. We propose a new regularization method that minimizes the discrepancy between domain-speciﬁc latent feature representations directly in the hidden activation space. Although some standard distribution matching approaches exist that can be interpreted as the matching of weighted sums of moments, e.g. Maximum Mean Discrepancy, an explicit orderwise matching of higher order moments has not been considered before. We propose to match the higher order central moments of probability distributions by means of order-wise moment differences. Our model does not require computationally expensive distance and kernel matrix computations. We utilize the equivalent representation of probability distributions by moment sequences to deﬁne a new distance function, called Central Moment Discrepancy ({CMD}). We prove that {CMD} is a metric on the set of probability distributions on a compact interval. We further prove that convergence of probability distributions on compact intervals w. r. t. the new metric implies convergence in distribution of the respective random variables. We test our approach on two different benchmark data sets for object recognition (Ofﬁce) and sentiment analysis of product reviews (Amazon reviews). {CMD} achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on most domain adaptation tasks of Ofﬁce and outperforms networks trained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy, Variational Fair Autoencoders and Domain Adversarial Neural Networks on Amazon reviews. In addition, a post-hoc parameter sensitivity analysis shows that the new approach is stable w. r. t. parameter changes in a certain interval. The source code of the experiments is publicly available1.},

	abstract = {Domain adaptation is to transfer the shared knowledge learned from the source domain to a new environment, i.e., target domain. One common practice is to train the model on both labeled source-domain data and unlabeled target-domain data. Yet the learned models are usually biased due to the strong supervision of the source domain. Most researchers adopt the early-stopping strategy to prevent over-ﬁtting, but when to stop training remains a challenging problem since the lack of the target-domain validation set. In this paper, we propose one efﬁcient bootstrapping method, called Adaboost Student, explicitly learning complementary models during training and liberating users from empirical early stopping. Adaboost Student combines deep model learning with the conventional training strategy, i.e., adaptive boosting, and enables interactions between learned models and the data sampler. We adopt one adaptive data sampler to progressively facilitate learning on hard samples and aggregate “weak” models to prevent overﬁtting. Extensive experiments show that (1) Without the need to worry about the stopping time, {AdaBoost} Student provides one robust solution by efﬁcient complementary model learning during training. (2) {AdaBoost} Student is orthogonal to most domain adaptation methods, which can be combined with existing approaches to further improve the state-of-the-art performance. We have achieved competitive results on three widely-used scene segmentation domain adaptation benchmarks.},

	abstract = {The generalized Hough transform ({GHT}), introduced by Dana H. Ballard in 1981, is the modification of the Hough transform using the principle of template matching. The Hough transform was initially developed to detect analytically defined shapes (e.g., line, circle, ellipse etc.). In these cases, we have knowledge of the shape and aim to find out its location and orientation in the image. This modification enables the Hough transform to be used to detect an arbitrary object described with its model.
The problem of finding the object (described with a model) in an image can be solved by finding the model's position in the image. With the generalized Hough transform, the problem of finding the model's position is transformed to a problem of finding the transformation's parameter that maps the model into the image. Given the value of the transformation's parameter, the position of the model in the image can be determined.
The original implementation of the {GHT} used edge information to define a mapping from orientation of an edge point to a reference point of the shape. In the case of a binary image where pixels can be either black or white, every black pixel of the image can be a black pixel of the desired pattern thus creating a locus of reference points in the Hough space. Every pixel of the image votes for its corresponding reference points. The maximum points of the Hough space indicate possible reference points of the pattern in the image. This maximum can be found by scanning the Hough space or by solving a relaxed set of equations, each of them corresponding to a black pixel.},

              In this work we introduce the confluent and various sizes image analysis method ({COVASIAM}), an automated colony count technique that uses digital imaging technology for detection and separation of confluent microbial colonies and colonies of various sizes growing on petri dishes. The proposed method takes advantage of the optical properties of the surfaces of most microbial colonies. Colonies in the petri dish are epi-illuminated in order to direct the reflection of concentrated light coming from a halogen lamp towards an image-sensing device. In conjunction, a multilevel threshold algorithm is proposed for colony separation and counting. These procedures improved the quantification of colonies showing confluence or differences in size. We tested {COVASIAM} with a sample set of microorganisms that form colonies with contrasting physical properties:
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              ,
              Aspergillus nidulans
              ,
              Escherichia coli
              ,
              Azotobacter vinelandii
              ,
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa
              , and
              Rhizobium etli
              . These physical properties range from smooth to hairy, from bright to opaque, and from high to low convexities. {COVASIAM} estimated an average of 95.47\% (ς = 8.55\%) of the manually counted colonies, while an automated method based on a single-threshold segmentation procedure estimated an average of 76\% (ς = 16.27) of the manually counted colonies. This method can be easily transposed to almost every image-processing analyzer since the procedures to compile it are generically standard.},

The method includes highly speciﬁc and effective object recognition algorithms that ensure very high detection accuracy. The processing sequence implies internal controls therefore enabling reliable automated evaluations of series of images. Use of the Fuzzy formalism and the high adaptivity of the algorithms lead to an extraordinary user-friendliness. For digitization different devices like ﬂatbed scanners or {CCD}-cameras can be used. Due to the highly adaptive algorithms samples from the routine standard preparation process in laboratories can be evaluated.

Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of {ML}, thus achiev‑ing outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of {DL} is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The {DL} field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, {DL} has outperformed well-known {ML} techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contrib‑uted several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on {DL}, all of them only tackled one aspect of the {DL}, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of {DL}. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most impor‑tant aspects of {DL} and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of {DL}, presents the types of {DL} tech‑niques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) which the most utilized {DL} network type and describes the development of {CNNs} architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the {AlexNet} network and closing with the High-Resolution network ({HR}.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major {DL} applications. Computational tools including {FPGA}, {GPU}, and {CPU} are summarized along with a description of their influence on {DL}.

Combining the advantages of these two directions while overcoming some of their limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework for fusing the information from physics-based performance models with deep learning algorithms for prognostics of complex safety-critical systems under real-world scenarios. In the proposed framework, we use physics-based performance models to infer unobservable model parameters related to a system’s components health solving a calibration problem. These parameters are subsequently combined with sensor readings and used as input to a deep neural network to generate a data-driven prognostics model with physics-augmented features. The performance of the hybrid framework is evaluated on an extensive case study comprising runto-failure degradation trajectories from a ﬂeet of nine turbofan engines under real ﬂight conditions. The experimental results show that the hybrid framework outperforms purely data-driven approaches by extending the prediction horizon by nearly 127\%. Furthermore, it requires less training data and is less sensitive to the limited representativeness of the dataset compared to purely data-driven approaches.},

	abstract = {One of the most important challenges in {HumanRobot} Interaction ({HRI}) is the perception of the human state. When a robot physically engages with a human, such as during physical interaction and assistance, it is vital that the robot perceives as much information as possible about the human to properly guide its behavior. We examined the specific case of a robot handing a rigid object to a human and used only the robot’s force and motion sensors to determine when the human’s grasp was secure enough for the robot to safely release the object. From biomechanical reasoning, we assumed that safer grasps are stiffer grasps. We commanded our robot to impose small motions on the object being passed and measured the resulting force changes and used system identification techniques to measure and visualize changes in the human’s grasp stiffness. When subjects were instructed to grasp more tightly an object being passed, our robot could reliably detect increases in several measures of the multi-dimensional stiffness of the human’s grasp. Our technique also enabled us to measure the increases in damping with tighter grasps. This preliminary work demonstrates promising value for active haptic perception during physical {HRI}.},

Our experimental setup consists of a hovercraft propelled by racing drone propellers mounted on a lightweight foam base, allowing it to float and be controlled freely on an air hockey table. We learn parametrized physics-inspired nonlinear models directly from data trajectories, leveraging gradient-based optimization techniques prevalent in machine learning research. The chosen model structure allows us to control the position of the hovercraft precisely on the air hockey table. We then analyze the prediction performance and demonstrate the closed-loop control performance on the real system.},
