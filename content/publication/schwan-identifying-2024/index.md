abstract: We present the identification of the non-linear dynamics of a novel hovercraft
  design, employing end-to-end deep learning techniques. Our experimental setup consists
  of a hovercraft propelled by racing drone propellers mounted on a lightweight foam
  base, allowing it to float and be controlled freely on an air hockey table. We learn
  parametrized physics-inspired nonlinear models directly from data trajectories,
  leveraging gradient-based optimization techniques prevalent in machine learning
  research. The chosen model structure allows us to control the position of the hovercraft
  precisely on the air hockey table. We then analyze the prediction performance and
  demonstrate the closed-loop control performance on the real system.
