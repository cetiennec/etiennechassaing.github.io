abstract: One of the most important challenges in HumanRobot Interaction (HRI) is
  the perception of the human state. When a robot physically engages with a human,
  such as during physical interaction and assistance, it is vital that the robot perceives
  as much information as possible about the human to properly guide its behavior.
  We examined the specific case of a robot handing a rigid object to a human and used
  only the robot’s force and motion sensors to determine when the human’s grasp was
  secure enough for the robot to safely release the object. From biomechanical reasoning,
  we assumed that safer grasps are stiffer grasps. We commanded our robot to impose
  small motions on the object being passed and measured the resulting force changes
  and used system identification techniques to measure and visualize changes in the
  human’s grasp stiffness. When subjects were instructed to grasp more tightly an
  object being passed, our robot could reliably detect increases in several measures
  of the multi-dimensional stiffness of the human’s grasp. Our technique also enabled
  us to measure the increases in damping with tighter grasps. This preliminary work
  demonstrates promising value for active haptic perception during physical HRI.
