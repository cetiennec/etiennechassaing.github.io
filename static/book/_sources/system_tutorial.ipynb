    "## 1. System Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of a circular pipe through which water flows continuously. A heater is connected at the entrance ($x = 0$) \n",
    "of the pipe, providing a constant power input $P$ to the water. The water flows with constant velocity $u$, losing heat \n",
    "to the environment due to convection. At the outlet, the water returns to the heater, creating a closed loop.\n",

    "From this we observe :\n",
    "- Stair-like behavior due to the recirculation\n",
    "- An inlet temperature that can go close to 100°C despite an outlet temperature that is barely above 85°C\n",
    "- A significant delay (~12 min)\n",
    "- A coupling and an intrication between inlet and outlet temperature\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This simulation divides a pipe into small segments to model heat transfer step by step. At each time step, every segment’s \n",
    "temperature is updated based on its neighbors and the environment, while the temperature at the pipe’s end is \"pushed forward\" \n",
    "to the start—like a wave of heat moving through. The heater at one end injects warmth, and the animation reveals how heat spreads, \n",
