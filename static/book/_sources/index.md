# Project tutorials

This page presents some technical projects I made in a tutorial format. The goal is to showcase the method and the results.
Equations and code are used to present the thinking process but are not detailed as is.
ALl projects can be opened on Google Colab to play interactively with the simulations.

Following projects are presented:

### Long pipe thermal control

How to control the output temperature of a 450m pipe close to the boiling temperature ? 
Check out 3 methods to do so.


### Parrot drone precision landing

Why is controlling a drone remotely still a difficult task ? Check out what type of implementation issues can affect performances.
